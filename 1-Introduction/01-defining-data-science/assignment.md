# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | Dropping attendance | Attendance of students who are attending the calsses, and pictures of students in the class at random intervals | The text data can be stored in a csv file and images can be stored on a cloud for easier access | Looking at the text data averages, we can guage the attendace patterns over different hours/classes during the day and try to narrow it down eventually to the core of the problem|
| Vaccination | Peoples confidence in getting a vaccine | Number of people who were effected negatively and positively by the vaccines | A simple survey or data from a hospital about number of visits made by a patient after and before being vaccinated | From the historical data, we can draw relations between vaccines and number of people it helped who had higher risk of disease by preventing it |
| Productivity | Attention span of younger generations is much lower than their previous generations which might impede their abiltiy to be productive in a long run since they cannot concentrate on a single thing until it gets accomplished | Get data of what a person does during their regular work hours, during breaks, etc., | A simple short video or essay written by the individuals | Extract the keywords to identify behavioural patterns which help us find the differences between most productive and likely least productive individual |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
